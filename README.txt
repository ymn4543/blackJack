BlackJack assignment

This was a really fun project to work on, I enjoyed it a lot!

Areas I found challenging:
- Implementing the splitting functionality
- Accounting for different possibilities each round
- Minimizing conditionals
- Deciding where to put certain functions (for example the end game scenarios could have went into
                                            the player or dealer class)
- Using interfaces (need to refresh myself on that)
- Testing (I did not have time to include major tests but I included some testing scenarios using different
  decks. I also did not do any unit testing as this is something I'm not quite familiar with yet.

Areas I enjoyed:
- Creating a functional deck of cards
- Calculating hand values
- Incorporating full functionality. There are no parts of the game I wasn't able to implement.
- The betting system.
- Dealer behavior, user choice.
- Modeling real life objects
- Refreshing my object oriented programming skills.

Thanks for this opportunity, look forward to discussing the code with you.
